<h3>Leasons Learned</h3>
My major goal for this project was to learn how to upload videos or images from a user to a website or application. What this project turned into was a full and in depth guide to using and implimenting Create-React-App. While I did do a lot of research on how to upload videos, I hit a few road bumps along the way, and was unable to actually impliment that feature into the site. That being said, these road bumps I found working through my application gave me a much better understanding of state, and the React Life cycle and how to work with Create React App overall.
